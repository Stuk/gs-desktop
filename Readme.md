This simple Python application wraps the fantastic HTML5 Grooveshark player in
a delicious Webkit wrapper, with a sprinkling of media key controls over the
top.

Bugs and todo
-------------

This was put together in a couple of hours one evening, and so is not the
epitome of music players. Things that could be improved:

 * Change the window title to match the document title (simple)
 * Maintain login across program launches (needs cookies, hard)
 * Provide notifications on song change (popups: easy, working out when the song
   has changed: a bit harder)

Enjoy!
